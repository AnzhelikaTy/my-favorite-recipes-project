<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>6 vine-ripened tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>¾ onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
    <li>1 fresh red chile pepper, seeded and chopped</li>
    <li>1 cup dry white wine, or more as needed</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
    <li>2 (4 ounce) cod loin</li>
    <li>8 large uncooked prawns, peeled and deveined</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Slice an 'X' in the bottom of each tomato. Bring a pot of water to a boil; boil tomatoes for 2 minutes. 
    Remove with a slotted spoon and place in a bowl of iced water for 1 minute. 
    Peel tomatoes, starting from the 'X' side; chop.</li>
<li>Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until fragrant, about 2 minutes. 
    Add chile pepper and tomatoes; cook and stir until tomatoes begin reduce, 5 to 8 minutes. Pour in wine; cook over medium heat until wine reduces slightly, about 5 more minutes. 
    Stir in salt, black pepper, basil, and parsley.</li>
<li>Place cod loins into tomato mixture; cover and cook for 5 minutes. Turn cod and cook other side until fish flakes easily with a fork, 3 to 5 minutes. 
    Add prawns; cover and cook until prawns are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, 2 to 3 minutes. 
    Season with salt and black pepper.</li>

</ol>
