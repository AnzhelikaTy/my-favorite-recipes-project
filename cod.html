        <li>6 vine-ripened tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>¾ onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 fresh red chile pepper, seeded and chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup dry white wine, or more as needed</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>2 (4 ounce) cod loin</li>
        <li>8 large uncooked prawns, peeled and deveined</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Slice an 'X' in the bottom of each tomato. Bring a pot of water to a boil; boil tomatoes for 2 minutes.
            Remove with a slotted spoon and place in a bowl of iced water for 1 minute.
            Peel tomatoes, starting from the 'X' side; chop.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until fragrant, about 2
            minutes.
            Add chile pepper and tomatoes; cook and stir until tomatoes begin reduce, 5 to 8 minutes. Pour in wine; cook
            over medium heat until wine reduces slightly, about 5 more minutes.
            Stir in salt, black pepper, basil, and parsley.</li>
        <li>Place cod loins into tomato mixture; cover and cook for 5 minutes. Turn cod and cook other side until fish
            flakes easily with a fork, 3 to 5 minutes.
            Add prawns; cover and cook until prawns are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent
            in the center, 2 to 3 minutes.
            Season with salt and black pepper.</li>

    </ol>
